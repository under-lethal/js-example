	<h2>The &lt;script&gt; Tag</h2>
		<p>In HTML, JavaScript code must inseretd betwen < script > and </ script > tags.</p>

	<h2>JavaScript Functions an Events</h2>
		<p>A JavaScript <b>function</b> is a block of JavaScript code, that can be executed when "called" for. 
		For example, a function can be called when an <strong>event</strong> occurs, like when the user clicks a button.</p>

	<h2>JavaScript in < head > or < body ></h2>
		<p>You can place any number of scripts in an HTML document.<br>
		Scripts can be placed in the < body >, or in the < head > section of an HTML page, or in both.
		<b>Placing scripts at the bottom of the  < body > element improves the display speed, because script compilation slows down the display.</b></p>

	<h2>External JavaScript</h2>
		<p>Scrpts can be also be placed in external files:<br>
		External scripts are practical when the same code is used in many different web pages.<br>
		JavaScript files have the file extenstion <b>.js</b>
		To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src (source) attributte of a < script > tag.</p>
			<script src="myScript.js"></script>
		<p>You can place an external script reference in < head > or < body > as you like.<br>
		The script will behave as if it was located exactly where teh < script > tag is located.
		<b>External scripts cannot contain < script > tags.</b></p>

	<h2>External JS Advantages</h2>
		<p>PLacing scripts in external files has some advantages:
			<ul>
				<li>It separates HTML and code</li>
				<li>It makes Htmls and JavaScript easier to read and mantain</li>
				<li>Cached JavaScript files cand speed up page loads</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

	<h2>External References</h2>
		<p>External scripts can be referenced with a full URL or with relative to the current web page.</p>
		<p>This example uses a full URL to link to a script:</p>
			<script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"> </script>

		<p>This example uses a script located in a specified folder on the current website:</p>
			<script src="/js/myScript1.js">	</script>

		<p>This example links to a script located in the same folder as the curent page:</p>
			<script src="myScript1.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
