	<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
	<p>In HTML, JavaScript statements are "instructions" to be "executed" by the web browser.<br>
	This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly". inside an HTML element with id="demo".</p>
	<p id="demo"></p>
	<script>
		document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
	</script>

	<h2>JavaScript Programs</h2>
	<p>Most JavaScript programs contain many JavaScript statements.<br>
	The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written.<br>
	In this example x, y, and z are given values and finally z is displayed:
	<b>JavaScript programs (and JS statements) are often called JavaScript code.</b></p>

	<h2>Semicolons ;</h2>
	<p>Semicolons separate JavaScript statements.<br>
	Add a semicolon at the end of each executable statement:<br>
	When se[arated by semicolons, multiple statements on one line are allowed;</p>
	<p id="demo0"></p>
	<script>
		var a,b,c;
		a = 1; b = 2; c = a + b;
		document.getElementById("demo0").innerHTML = c
	</script>
	<p><b>Ending statements with semicolon is not required, but highly recommended.</b></p>

	<h2>JavaScript White Space</h2>
	<p>JavaScript ignores multiple spaces. You can add white space to your script to make it more readable.</p>

	<h2>JavaScript Line Lenght and Line Breaks</h2>
	<p>For best readability, programers often like to avoid code lines longer than 80 characters.<br>
	If a JavaScript statements does not fit on one line, the best place to break it, is after an operator:</p>
	<p id = "demo2"></p>
	<script>
		document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = 
		"Hello Dolly.";
	</script>

	<h2>JavaScript Code Blocks</h2>
	<p>JavaScript statements can be grouped together in the code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.<br>
	The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.<br>
	One place you will find statements grouped together in bloks, is in JavaScript functions:</p>
	<button type="button" onclick="myFunction()">Click Me!</button>

	<p id="demo3"></p>
	<p id="demo4"></p>
	<script>
		function myFunction() {
			document.getElementById("demo3").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly";
			document.getElementById("demo4").innerHTML = "How are you?";
		}
	</script>

	<h2>JavaScript Keywords</h2>
	<p>JavaScript statements often start with a <b>keyword</b> to identify the JavaScript action to be performed.</p>
